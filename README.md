## Overview
**Consyzer** is a CLI utility designed to prevent CIL module consistency issues when using P/Invoke mechanisms to call methods implemented outside the managed CLR environment.

## What for?
In CIL application development, it is not uncommon to need access to methods implemented outside the managed .NET ecosystem. In the source code of a CIL module, such calls are described using the **DllImport** or **LibraryImport** attributes and are stored in the module's metadata after compilation, indicating which unmanaged (native) library should be loaded at runtime and which function should be called from it.

A key feature of such calls is that the function code from the unmanaged library is not linked directly with the CIL module's code;
instead, the module's metadata stores information about the function being called, including a reference to the expected location of the unmanaged library containing the implementation of that function on the system.

```csharp
// In this example, "foo.dll" is a reference to an unmanaged library containing the implementation of the HelloWorld function:
[DllImport("foo.dll")]
static extern void HelloWorld();

// or

[LibraryImport("foo.dll")]
static partial void HelloWorld();
```

The application functions correctly without compromising system integrity and security as long as all unmanaged libraries are present at the locations described in the metadata;
however, if even one of the libraries is missing, the application will not only crash but may also pose a security risk.

> ⚠️ The analysis is based on the metadata stored in CIL assemblies and does not evaluate the correctness of marshaling between managed and unmanaged code.

Consyzer was created to ensure that such situations do not come as a surprise.

## How does it work?
1. Consyzer selects files for analysis based on the specified directory and search pattern;  
2. Consyzer logs and excludes from analysis any files that are not ECMA-355 assemblies;  
3. Consyzer analyzes the remaining ECMA assemblies for the presence of P/Invoke calls;  
4. Consyzer analyzes each found P/Invoke method and checks whether the corresponding native libraries exist in the system;  
5. Consyzer generates a report based on the analysis results in one or more formats depending on the configuration;  
6. Consyzer returns an exit code indicating the specific analysis result, which also enables you to handle analysis incidents in accordance with your requirements.

## Analysis Results
**Consyzer** presents analysis results in the form of reports.  
The following report formats are supported:

1. `Console`
2. `Json`
3. `Csv`
4. `Xml`

### Exit Codes
**Consyzer** returns a specific exit code depending on where the native libraries specified in P/Invoke attributes were or were not found:

| Code | Meaning                                                                                     |
|------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| 0    | All libraries were found in the analyzed directory                                          |
| 1    | One or more libraries were found in the system directory                                    |
| 2    | One or more libraries were found via the **PATH** environment variable                      |
| 3    | One or more libraries were found by absolute path                                           |
| 4    | One or more libraries were found by relative path                                           |
| 5    | One or more libraries were not found in the system                                          |

> The analysis codes match the order in which **Consyzer** searches for libraries in the system.  
> If libraries are found in different locations, the highest corresponding code is returned.  
> Only the last code means that at least one library was not found.

| Code | Configuration or execution error                                                            |
|------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| -1   | Analysis directory not specified                                                            |
| -2   | File search pattern not specified                                                           |
| -3   | No files found in the directory matching the pattern                                        |
| -4   | None of the found files were valid for analysis                                             |

> Negative codes signal configuration errors or failures that occurred during the utility’s execution.  
> The lower the code, the **further the utility progressed before the error occurred**.

## How to run?
**Consyzer** is run from the command line (CLI) and requires two mandatory parameters:

1. `--AnalysisDirectory` — sets the directory containing CIL modules to analyze;  
2. `--SearchPattern` — sets the search pattern for CIL modules to analyze.

You can also specify two optional parameters:

1. `--RecursiveSearch` — specifies whether to search for CIL modules in subdirectories. Default: `false`.  
2. `--OutputFormat` — sets the report output format (`Console`, `Json`, `Csv`, `Xml`). Multiple values supported via comma. Default: `Console`.

### General usage pattern
```
Consyzer.exe --AnalysisDirectory <path_to_directory> --SearchPattern <search_pattern> [--RecursiveSearch true|false] [--OutputFormat Console, Json, Csv, Xml]
```

### Example
```
Consyzer.exe --AnalysisDirectory C:\Modules --SearchPattern "*.dll, *.exe" --RecursiveSearch true --OutputFormat Console, Json
```

## Analyzing multiple projects in a solution
You can use [this](https://github.com/Maslinin/Consyzer/blob/master/DevOps/SolutionAnalyzer.ps1) PowerShell script to analyze the output artifacts of all projects in a solution.  
This script can also be used in a **CI/CD pipeline**.
